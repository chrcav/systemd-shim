Changes in version 8
=====================

 - build system cleanups, added some warning CFLAGS

 - fixed some harmless warnings

 - stop doing async calls to cgmanager to avoid races where we return
   to our caller before the operation is actually complete

 - fix StartTransientUnit signature for systemd >= 209

 - add working support for StopUnit and Abandon on scopes

Changes in version 7
=====================

 - changes to work with new logind version
   - add stubs for Subscribe and Unsubscribe
   - support cgroups with transient units for scopes and slices

 - use "shutdown -h" instead of "poweroff" to respect /etc/default/halt

 - sync dbus security policy file with upstream (systemd)

Changes in version 6
=====================

 - flush the proper bus (system bus) on shutdown

Changes in version 5
=====================

 - write a sendsigs.omit.d file to prevent upstart from killing us
   during shutdown.  This should fix the suspend-when-shutting-down
   issue once and for all.

Changes in version 4
=====================

 - don't exit-on-idle while shutting down to avoid losing the flag
   that tells us we are in the middle of a shutdown

 - flush bus before exiting on idle to avoid a race where a message
   is queued up but not yet sent

 - adjust the definition of "inactivity" to be 10 seconds after done
   processing the last request instead of 10 seconds after we started.
   This matters for long-running tasks (like suspends).

Changes in version 3
=====================

 - add a proper 'Unit' interface

 - clean up the interface to and implementation of the NTP support

 - add support for the poweroff, reboot, suspend, hibernate targets

Changes in version 2
=====================

 - Install a ntp-units.d file so that never versions of timedated don't assume
   that NTP is impossible.

 - dist the NEWS

Changes in version 1
=====================

 - Initialise the Virtualization id variable so that we return "" in the
   case that detecting virtualisation fails.
